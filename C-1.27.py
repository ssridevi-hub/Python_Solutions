# In Section 1.8, we provided three different implementations of a generator that computes factors of a given integer. 
# The third of those implementations, from page 41, was the most efÔ¨Åcient, but we noted that it did not yield the factors 
# nincreasing order. Modify the generator so that it reports factors in increasing order, while maintaining its general 
# performance advantages
