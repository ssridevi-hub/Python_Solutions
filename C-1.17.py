# C-1.17 
# Had we implemented the scale function (page 25) as follows, does it work properly?
    def scale(data, factor):
    for val in data:
    val = factor
    Explain why or why not.


#ANS
#It will not work properly because the current value in data is copied into val which is then scaled by the factor. This 
#does not affect the contents of data
