# C-1.16.py
# In our implementation of the scale function (page 25), the body of the loop
# executes the command data[j] = factor. We have discussed that numeric
# types are immutable, and that use of the = operator in this context causes
# the creation of a new instance (not the mutation of an existing instance).
# How is it still possible, then, that our implementation of scale changes the
# actual parameter sent by the caller?

#ANS
#Though numeric types are immutable, lists of numeric types are mutable: the values within them can change. The list thus
#retains its identity while its contents change
